A next-generation, AI-enhanced video review platform revolutionizing e-commerce trust through authentic, short-form, user-generated content.

**Critique Canopy** is a next-generation review platform designed to transform conventional text-based product reviews into short-form, user-generated video testimonials. The system enhances credibility, promotes user engagement, and combats misinformation using artificial intelligence techniques for moderation. By integrating tightly with platforms such as Amazon, this system enables contextual, transparent, and socially interactive review mechanisms, thus building consumer trust and improving the online shopping experience.

**Key Features**
1.**Short-Form Video Reviews**: Users can record and publish concise product reviews using video format for higher authenticity and relatability.
2.**AI-Based Review Validation**: Employs machine learning to detect and suppress fake, spammed, or incentivized reviews.
3.**Community Interaction Modules**: Includes features for voting, commenting, and sharing to enhance engagement.
4.**E-Commerce Integration**: Directly associates video reviews with Amazon product listings.
5.**Planned Extensions**: Support for multi-language auto-subtitling, blockchain-based verification, and augmented reality overlays.

**Technology Stack**
1.**Front-End** -	React.js, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Lucide Icons
2.**Back-End** - Express.js, TypeScript, Drizzle ORM
3.**Database** - PostgreSQL
4.**Styling** - TailwindCSS, PostCSS
5.**Authentication** - Passport.js (Local Strategy), express-session
6.**Build Tools** -	Vite, Esbuild
7.**AI (Planned)** -	TensorFlow, Facial Sentiment Analysis

**System Architecture**
The application consists of the following subsystems:
1.**Client Interface**: Built with React and Tailwind for users to upload and view product reviews.
2.**Backend API**: Handles session management, review storage, comment threads, and Amazon integration.
3.**AI Moderation Engine**: Detects anomalies in video content (planned module).
